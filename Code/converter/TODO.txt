flow diagram

//translate PM column names to SEED column names
//make a POST request to SEED to upload PM excel template
get a list A of addresses from the PM template
make a QUERY to download the building snapshot id for each address in list A
    if building b is in SEED database, return the snapshot id
        make a QUERY to download cononical id
    otherwise, make it None or something that indecate there isn't such a building yet

building snapshot id
cononical building id (+)

No need to check if the meter id is valid
