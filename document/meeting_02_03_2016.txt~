TODO for the next week

1. report sets of buildings we need to ask for energy data

search box folder to find:
    S: the building ids for the 400 buildings with 15 min interval data
    D: the building ids for the 80 BAS buildings with all data

in ECM high level action sheet, rank by time, intersect it with
previous two sets of buildings S (400 buildings) and D (80 buildings),
list the intersected set of buildings, S' and D' that has both energy
data and ECM action completion date

D (80 buildings): buildings with GSALink program, 8 has ECM completion
date information.

*. compare degree day calculation method

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. analyze ECM action only vs. no ECM action building energy
distribution

analyse the distribution of "Advanced metering" action
only and "building envelope" action only for high level ECM action and
create plots for total EUI, Electric EUI and Gas EUI

3. Continue modify weather normalization routine

3.1 correct the baseload calculation method

3.2 add month notation to the plots: denote each data point with a
number denoting which month it is in

3.3 change y axis label to
    "monthly total gas + electricity [kbtu/sq. ft.]"
    "monthly total gas [kbtu/sq. ft.]"
    "monthly total electricity [kbtu/sq. ft.]"

3.4 change the color coding of gas, electric and combined plot:

*   electric plot use turcoise in the combined plot, and in
    electricity-cdd plot use a shade of light to dark denoting year
    2013 to 2015

*   electric plot use orange in the combined plot, and in gas-hdd plot
    use a shade of light to dark denoting year 2013 to 2015
